- Story-driven presentation with insights and recommendations

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Technology** shows consistently elevated return rates (≈8–9%), which may indicate recurring issues such as product quality concerns or mismatched customer expectations.
- **Furniture** exhibits a sharp return-rate spike in **2021 (9.4%)**, a pattern that often correlates with supply-chain or vendor-related fluctuations.
- **Western states** (CA, OR, WA) have the highest concentration of returns (11–12%), suggesting potential regional factors such as fulfillment challenges or transportation-related damage.
- **Seasonal peaks** in **January (7.3%)** and **August (7.0%)** align with typical post-holiday and mid-year promotion cycles when return volumes naturally increase.
- A **small group of customers** returns **50–100%** of purchases, significantly impacting operational costs and indicating the need for review of return policy or customer segmentation.
- Sub-categories with the **highest return-to-sales loss ratio** — posing the biggest financial risk — are: **Art**, **Supplies** and **Bookcases**.
